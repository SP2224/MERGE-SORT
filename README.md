# MERGE-SORT
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.

# APPROACH
Step 1 − if it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return.
#
Step 2 − divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
#
Step 3 − merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.


# Merge Sort Complexity
## Time Complexity
### Best Case Complexity: O(n*log n)

### Worst Case Complexity: O(n*log n)

### Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n)

# Space Complexity
The space complexity of merge sort is O(n).
